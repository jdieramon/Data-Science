This is the collection of code that I have used for the 'Course Project 2' in the Exploratory Data Analysis course. I keep the codes here for my personal records. 

#### plot1.R
The code plots the Pm2.5 total emission for US (1999-2008) and the linear regression of the data.

#### plot2.R
The code plots the Pm2.5 total emission for Baltimore (1999-2008) and the linear regression of the data.

#### plot3.R
The code plots emissions for Baltimore  (1999-2008) over 4 different emission types and the linear regression.

#### plot4.R
The code plots the emissions of coal combustion-related sources across US (1999-2008) and the #linear regression.
There have been a long thread in the Forum about how to identify coal-combustion related sources. I have endorsed one of the accepted criteria in the forum: the EI.Sector contains 3 categories  coal-based within the sector fuel combustion. It can be consulted here: http://www.epa.gov/air/emissions/basic.htm

#### plot5.R
The code plots emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City (1999â€“2008)
There have been a long thread in the Forum about how to interpret the term "motor vehicles" Here, I am using the Robert eugene lobel criteria, that can be found under the following link: 
https://class.coursera.org/exdata-031/forum/thread?thread_id=120#post-527 .Briefly, it acknowledges that the term can be interpreted differently depending on one's frame of reference. I am using the most common definition of Motor Vehicles in the US: the Mobile sector is "Vehicles"-based. It can be consulted here: http://www.epa.gov/air/emissions/basic.htm

#### plot6.R
The code plots and compares emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California.
